## Overview
**Star Fisher** is a singleplayer PC game where you play as a small robot sent by a feline-run megacorporation to harvest aquatic life on a distant ocean planet. From your starfish-shaped orbital station, you cast lines through the atmosphere into vibrant alien oceans, reeling in strange creatures and uncovering biomes hidden by storms and magnetic chaos.  

Catch unique fish, earn gold, upgrade your gear and station, and shape alien ecosystems while trading discoveries with your corporate meowsters. The goal is to rise from a lonely scout into the most renowned fisher in the stars.

## Story Premise
In a galaxy ruled by superintelligent cats, exploration is outsourced to fleets of fishing robots. You are one such unit, deployed to a storm-shrouded planet that hides endless oceans and evolving life. Your task: catalog, collect, and survive. From shrimp-like starters in the shallows to leviathans in volcanic trenches, each catch pushes you deeper into discovery.
